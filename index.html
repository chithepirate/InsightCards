          <!-- <p>
            Nature related insight
          </p> -->
          <h3>What we observed:</h3>
          <p>
            During our expedition around Dundee, we chose to visit the Dundee
            Botanical Gardens, as this was the perfect location we’d been
            looking for… The link between urban and nature we were aiming to
            follow (according to the themes we got from our post-it brainstorm session).
            Navigating your way to the gardens is extremely easy with lots of
            signs and university banners telling you where to go. This is also
            maintained while on the grounds of the garden with lots of labels
            and maps throughout. Not only do the gardens offer the most
            beautiful wildlife in the entirety of Dundee, but the environment is
            extremely peaceful and contrasts the busy and “always on the go”
            energy present in the city.
            <br>
      <br>  What caught our attention the most was how the visitors moved around
      the gardens: they took their time to just take in their environment.
      It felt as though time had stopped and people were taking in one another’s
      company, connecting with each other… there seemed to be a sense of joy and
      happiness in the air as passers-by smiled, nodded their heads and made
      small comments about how stunning the gardens were at this time of year.

          </p>
          <h3>Why it matters:</h3>
          <p>
          The same way the Greenhouses of the garden transport you to a completely
          different setting, (both in temperature, humidity and plant variety)
          so do the spaces we submerge ourselves in. Towns that lack this kind
          of possibility to reconnect with nature or generally lack the presence
          of green areas, see their citizens suffer a lot more health-wise, both
          mentally and physically (save for the few who can afford frequent
          long-distance travel).
          <br>
    <br>  Looking after ourselves is just as important as looking after the
          environment. A symbiotic relationship between people and nature might
          bring us back on track in terms of living a more meaningful,
          respectful and sustainable life.

          <h3>What we observed:</h3>
          <p>
            <i> " (...)
            <br> Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay!
            <br> I hope that God will protect all passengers
            <br> By night and by day
            <br> And that no accident will befall them while crossing
            <br> The beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay
            <br> For that would be most awful to be seen
            <br> Near by Dundee and the Magdalen Green.
            <br> (...)" <br> – <b>“The Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay”</b></i>, William Topaz McGonagall
<br>
            <br> Our fieldwork exploration along the Waterfront lead to the discovery
            of several snippets of Dundonian history, among which, to be found
            engraved into the floor of the walk, was a piece dedicated to the
            Tay Railway Bridge by Scottish poet William Topaz McGonagall.
            <br> Further down the walk, just before the local café, a memorial can
            be seen describing the Tay Railway Bridge disaster that took place in 1879.
            <br>
            <br> There is a cruel irony to be had behind the timing of the disaster
            and when the poem was written, as the poem precedes the accident by
            a little over a year, effectively turning the quoted verses into a
            bad omen of sorts. The accident itself killed all 75 passengers and
            crew members on board of the train upon the bridge collapsing. It is
            still regarded as one of the worst railway bridge accidents to ever
            occur in the British Isles to this day.
          </p>
          <h3>Why it matters:</h3>
          <p>
            Accidents like these are what have shaped technology and infrastructure into continuously improving, developing into what we see and use presently. It is quite grim to think about, but without people or animals dying, we wouldn’t have access to a lot of pharmaceuticals and modern medicine… Or safer, typhoon-level wind resistant railway bridges.

          <h3>What we observed:</h3>
          <p>
            We made the most out of the Waterfront walk by exploring it on two separate occasions.
            During our visits, we gathered that the walk and its surroundings
            draw in a wide demographic. There were some students playing football,
            tiring out as their session went on, probably due to the wind taking
            control of the ball. On our first walk, we also came across a group
            of fishermen, which were not present the second time around due to
            the very rare event of the tide not being out. It was clear to us
            that they were very knowledgeable in their field. They were all well
            equipped for the task and seemed very focused on getting the catch of the day!
        <br>
        <br>With Dundee Airport being so close to the Waterfront, spotting
            Chesnas and other types of small planes landing every other minute
            was quite the experience. Some planes were incredibly loud, while
            others were quieter. Again, the wind might have played a role in the
            way that sound travelled.
          </p>
          <h3>Why it matters:</h3>
          <p>
            It is incredibly fascinating, how nature and natural conditions
            matter even in a somewhat urban setting, such as the Waterfront walkway.
            Without the river banks filled, no fishing activities take place
            during the day. With too strong a wind force, no planes can land
            safely at Dundee Airport. Even though we think we have evolved to
            outwit nature, nature always has its way. We will always be at the
            mercy of weather (and tidal) conditions, whether we like it or not,
            and with climate change at our doorstep, we will see changes that
            will shape the world in ways never seen before.
        <br>
        <br> The following audio clip details all the sounds we picked up on our Waterfront walk:

          <h3>What we observed:</h3>
          <p>
            The Dundonian city centre has proven to be the most humanly,
            culturally and acoustically rich area in the entirety of town.
            You could almost say it’s a live display of the society Scotland
            stand for, embodied in every single person, passer-by, performer
            and shop that you visit: every day it surprises you with something new.
      <br>
      <br> What caught our attention in particular, was a bagpipe duo consisting
           of a guy in a kilt, and a girl in a wheelchair, performing right outside
           the Overgate shopping centre for charity. They were lovely and it was
           heart-warming to see that no matter who you are or what life conditions
           you were born in, there is always a place for you inside of the community.
           A lot of people stopped to record and/or donate money.

          </p>
          <h3>Why it matters:</h3>
          <p>
            Not everyone has this welcoming aura and culture inside of the
            United Kingdom. A lot of the negative sentiment that drove Brits to
            vote for Brexit came from a background of discrimination and racism,
            if not unwarranted fear towards people coming from a different background,
            living and working in the country. This form of backwards mentality,
            tying into English colonialism, has led a lot of Brits into growing
            a superiority complex, out of what they perceived to be “pride” for their country.
      <br>
      <br>  The cultural divide between England and Scotland might really split
            the Kingdom apart in the future, if this gap cannot be closed.
            English folk need to learn that they are not in the imperialist era
            anymore, and that opening their mind to other cultures or befriending
            people with a different background is not going to harm them or the
            society they live in as a whole.
